# LCDd
Some of my own LCDd files

LCDd.conf is an example file for the LCDd configuration. This will require tuning for your application

ip.pl is a perl script to display the IP address of a single interface. I am not fluent in perl. So this is a modified verison of my best attempt to bend the tail.pl example (included with the LCDd source code) to my will.
